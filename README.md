# My personal web page
> This is the repo for my personal web page. 

## General info
This is my personal web page. There is a single landing page that redirects to my two sites: my Vegan Harte blog on vegan cuisine and my DJ Iván Harte techno portfolio.

## Built with
* HTML
* CSS (kept to the minimum to fix undesired issues with Bootstrap)
* Bootstrap (tried to use as many components and layout utilities as possible)
* JavaScript (a lot of vanilla JS to serve content dinamically)

## Status
_in progress_
The site is being built piece by piece. Theming decisions are still to be made, as well as filling the site with real content.

## Access the deployed version
This is the link to the deployed version: [https://www.ivanharte.com](https://www.ivanharte.com)

## Inspiration
This site is the result of two concurring needs: my (Ivan's) need of a personal web page to share my work as a vegan cook and as a techno DJ, and my partner (Darío)'s assignment at the IT Academy Front End Developer bootcamp to develop a website using Bootstrap.
